# Accessibility Audit Report

Date: 2025-04-09

## Overview

This report outlines accessibility issues identified in the AI Consulting Website project. The audit was conducted using manual code review and automated testing tools to identify potential WCAG 2.1 AA compliance issues.

## Summary of Findings

The website has several accessibility issues that need to be addressed to ensure it's accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The main issues fall into the following categories:

1. **Images and Alternative Text**
2. **Form Accessibility**
3. **Keyboard Navigation**
4. **Color Contrast**
5. **ARIA Attributes**
6. **Focus Management**
7. **Semantic HTML**

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Images and Alternative Text

#### Issues:

- **LazyImage Component**: While the component accepts an `alt` prop, there's no validation to ensure it's provided or meaningful.
- **Decorative Images**: Some images may be decorative but don't have `alt=""` to indicate this to screen readers.
- **SVG Elements**: SVG elements in components like `WaveDivider` lack proper accessibility attributes.

#### Recommendations:

- Add validation to ensure all images have appropriate alt text
- Mark decorative images with `alt=""` 
- Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVGs
- Add descriptive `<title>` and `<desc>` elements to informative SVGs

### 2. Form Accessibility

#### Issues:

- **Form Component**: While form labels exist, they're hidden with `sr-only` class but don't have proper associations with inputs.
- **Form Validation**: Error messages for form validation aren't announced to screen readers.
- **Form Submission**: No feedback is provided to screen readers upon form submission.

#### Recommendations:

- Ensure all form inputs have properly associated labels using `htmlFor` and `id` attributes
- Implement proper form validation with error messages that are announced to screen readers
- Add ARIA live regions for form submission feedback

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

#### Issues:

- **Interactive Elements**: Some interactive elements may not be properly focusable.
- **Focus Order**: The focus order may not follow a logical sequence.
- **Focus Indicators**: Focus indicators may not be visible enough for all users.

#### Recommendations:

- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators
- Test and fix the focus order to ensure it follows a logical sequence
- Enhance focus indicators for better visibility

### 4. Color Contrast

#### Issues:

- **Text Contrast**: Some text colors may not have sufficient contrast with their backgrounds.
- **UI Elements**: Some UI elements may not have sufficient contrast to be visible to all users.
- **Focus Indicators**: Focus indicators may not have sufficient contrast.

#### Recommendations:

- Audit all text colors against their backgrounds to ensure they meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Enhance contrast for UI elements and focus indicators

### 5. ARIA Attributes

#### Issues:

- **ARIA Roles**: Some components may be missing appropriate ARIA roles.
- **ARIA States**: Interactive elements may not properly communicate their states to screen readers.
- **ARIA Properties**: Some components may be missing necessary ARIA properties.

#### Recommendations:

- Add appropriate ARIA roles to components that need them
- Ensure interactive elements communicate their states properly
- Add necessary ARIA properties to enhance accessibility

### 6. Focus Management

#### Issues:

- **Modal Dialogs**: If modal dialogs are used, they may not trap focus properly.
- **Dynamic Content**: Dynamically added content may not receive focus when appropriate.
- **Focus Reset**: Focus may not be properly managed when content changes.

#### Recommendations:

- Implement proper focus trapping for modal dialogs
- Ensure dynamically added content receives focus when appropriate
- Manage focus properly when content changes

### 7. Semantic HTML

#### Issues:

- **Heading Hierarchy**: The heading hierarchy may not be properly structured.
- **Landmark Regions**: The page may not use appropriate landmark regions.
- **HTML5 Elements**: The page may not make full use of semantic HTML5 elements.

#### Recommendations:

- Ensure heading hierarchy is properly structured (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Add appropriate landmark regions (header, nav, main, footer, etc.)
- Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate

## Component-Specific Issues

### Button Component

- Ensure buttons have accessible names when only icons are used
- Verify that button roles are properly communicated to screen readers

### Form Component

- Add proper error handling and validation messages
- Ensure form labels are properly associated with inputs
- Add ARIA live regions for form feedback

### Header Component

- Ensure mobile menu is accessible via keyboard
- Add skip links for keyboard users to bypass navigation
- Verify that dropdown menus are accessible

### LazyImage Component

- Enforce alt text requirements
- Add loading indicators for screen readers

### WaveDivider Component

- Add appropriate ARIA attributes to SVG elements
- Ensure decorative elements are properly hidden from screen readers

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on high-impact issues first, such as form accessibility and keyboard navigation.
2. **Implement Fixes**: Address the issues identified in this report.
3. **Retest**: After implementing fixes, retest to ensure issues have been resolved.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement processes to ensure new features maintain accessibility standards.
