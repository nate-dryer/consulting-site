# Reports Directory

This directory contains reports and documentation for the AI Consulting Website project.

## Accessibility Reports

- **accessibility-audit-report.md**: A comprehensive accessibility audit report with detailed findings and recommendations.
- **component-accessibility-checklist.md**: A checklist of accessibility improvements for each component in the codebase.

## Accessibility Tools

The project includes several tools for accessibility testing and improvement:

### 1. Accessibility Audit

Run a comprehensive accessibility audit on the website:

```bash
npm run audit:a11y
```

This will generate a detailed report of accessibility issues found on each page of the website.

### 2. Accessibility Testing

Run automated accessibility tests using Playwright and axe-core:

```bash
npm run test:a11y
```

This will run accessibility tests on each page of the website and report any violations.

### 3. Fix Common Accessibility Issues

Automatically fix some common accessibility issues in the codebase:

```bash
npm run fix:a11y
```

This script will scan the codebase for common accessibility issues and fix them automatically. It's not a replacement for manual fixes, but it can help with some of the more straightforward issues.

## Bundle Analysis

Run a bundle analysis to identify opportunities for optimization:

```bash
npm run analyze:bundle
```

This will generate a report of the bundle size and identify opportunities for optimization.

## Best Practices

### Accessibility

1. **Run the accessibility audit regularly**: Run the accessibility audit regularly to identify and fix accessibility issues.
2. **Fix high-impact issues first**: Focus on high-impact issues first, such as keyboard navigation and form accessibility.
3. **Test with screen readers**: Test the website with screen readers to ensure it's accessible to users with visual impairments.
4. **Test with keyboard navigation**: Test the website with keyboard navigation to ensure it's accessible to users who can't use a mouse.
5. **Maintain accessibility documentation**: Keep the accessibility documentation up to date with the latest findings and recommendations.

### Performance

1. **Run the bundle analysis regularly**: Run the bundle analysis regularly to identify opportunities for optimization.
2. **Optimize images**: Optimize images to reduce their file size without sacrificing quality.
3. **Use code splitting**: Use code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.
4. **Lazy load components**: Lazy load components that aren't needed for the initial render.
5. **Monitor performance metrics**: Monitor performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).
