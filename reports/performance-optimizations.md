# Performance Optimizations Report

Date: 2025-04-09

## Overview

This report documents the performance optimizations made to the AI Consulting Website project. The optimizations focus on improving load times, reducing bundle size, and enhancing the user experience.

## Optimizations Made

### 1. Code Splitting

- **Dynamic Imports**: Implemented dynamic imports for non-critical components using Next.js's dynamic import functionality.
- **Dynamic Import Utility**: Created a utility function for consistent dynamic imports with proper loading and error states.
- **Component Splitting**: Split large components into smaller, more focused components that can be loaded independently.

### 2. Bundle Size Reduction

- **Bundle Analyzer**: Added bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies and optimization opportunities.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for images and components that aren't needed for the initial render.
- **Tree Shaking**: Ensured imports are tree-shaking friendly to reduce unused code.

### 3. Image Optimization

- **LazyImage Component**: Enhanced the LazyImage component to improve performance by only loading images when they're about to enter the viewport.
- **Next.js Image**: Used Next.js's Image component with appropriate width, height, and sizes props for optimal loading and CLS prevention.
- **Placeholder Images**: Added support for low-quality placeholder images while the full image loads.

### 4. Loading Performance

- **Loading Fallback**: Created a LoadingFallback component for a consistent loading experience.
- **Critical CSS**: Ensured critical CSS is inlined for faster initial rendering.
- **Font Loading**: Optimized font loading to reduce layout shifts.

### 5. Monitoring and Analysis

- **Bundle Analysis Script**: Created a script to analyze bundle size and identify optimization opportunities.
- **Performance Metrics**: Added monitoring for key performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).

## Components and Files Added

### 1. Dynamic Import Utility

Created a utility function for consistent dynamic imports with proper loading and error states:

```typescript
// app/utils/dynamicImport.ts
export function dynamicImport<T>(
  importFunc: () => Promise<{ default: ComponentType<T> }>,
  options: DynamicImportOptions = {}
) {
  const {
    ssr = true,
    loading,
  } = options;
  
  return dynamic(importFunc, {
    ssr,
    loading: loading || (loadingDelay > 0 ? () => null : undefined),
  });
}
```

### 2. Loading Fallback Component

Created a loading component for dynamic imports:

```typescript
// app/components/LoadingFallback.tsx
export default function DynamicLoadingFallback(loadingProps: DynamicOptionsLoadingProps) {
  const { error, isLoading, pastDelay } = loadingProps;
  
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="p-4 bg-red-50 text-red-700 rounded-md">
        <p>Error loading component: {error.message}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  if (!isLoading || !pastDelay) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return <LoadingFallback />;
}
```

### 3. Bundle Analysis Script

Created a script to analyze bundle size:

```javascript
// scripts/analyze-bundle.js
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

// Run the bundle analyzer
execSync('npm run analyze', { stdio: 'inherit' });

// Save tips to a file
fs.writeFileSync(reportFile, `
Bundle Analysis Report (${date})

Bundle analysis tips:
1. Look for large dependencies that could be dynamically imported
2. Check for duplicate dependencies
3. Identify unused code that could be removed
4. Consider code splitting for large components
`);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Further Code Splitting**: Identify more components that can be dynamically imported.
2. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure all imports are tree-shaking friendly.
3. **Third-Party Dependencies**: Review and optimize third-party dependencies.
4. **CSS Optimization**: Split CSS to reduce unused styles.
5. **Server-Side Rendering**: Optimize server-side rendering for faster initial load.
