Bundle Analysis Report (2025-04-08)

Bundle analysis tips:
1. Look for large dependencies that could be dynamically imported
2. Check for duplicate dependencies
3. Identify unused code that could be removed
4. Consider code splitting for large components

Common optimization strategies:
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Lazy load images and other media
- Minimize third-party dependencies
- Use tree-shaking friendly imports (e.g., import { Button } from 'library' instead of import Library from 'library')
- Consider smaller alternatives for large libraries
- Split CSS to reduce unused styles
