- **Accessibility Compliance**: Automated accessibility tests help ensure WCAG compliance.

### Files Added

- Jest configuration files: `jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`
- Playwright configuration: `playwright.config.ts`
- Unit tests: `__tests__/components/*.test.tsx`
- Visual tests: `e2e-tests/*.spec.ts`
- Accessibility tests: `e2e-tests/accessibility.spec.ts`
- Test utilities: `e2e-tests/utils/*.ts`

## 2. Performance Optimization

### Key Improvements

- **Code Splitting**: Implemented dynamic imports for non-critical components.
- **Bundle Analysis**: Added bundle analyzer to identify optimization opportunities.
- **Lazy Loading**: Enhanced image and component loading strategies.
- **Loading Experience**: Improved loading states and fallbacks.

### Benefits

- **Faster Initial Load**: Code splitting reduces the initial bundle size for faster loading.
- **Better User Experience**: Improved loading states provide a better user experience.
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Optimized assets reduce bandwidth usage.
- **Better Performance Metrics**: Improvements to Core Web Vitals metrics.

### Files Added

- Dynamic import utility: `app/utils/dynamicImport.ts`
- Loading fallback component: `app/components/LoadingFallback.tsx`
- Bundle analysis script: `scripts/analyze-bundle.js`
- Next.js bundle analyzer configuration in `next.config.js`

## 3. Accessibility

### Key Improvements

- **Color Contrast**: Improved color contrast for better readability.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced keyboard navigation with skip links and focus management.
- **Form Accessibility**: Improved form labels, validation, and feedback.
- **Image Accessibility**: Added proper alt text and loading indicators.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Added appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements.

### Benefits

- **Inclusive Design**: Accessible design benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance**: Helps meet legal requirements for accessibility.
- **Improved SEO**: Many accessibility improvements also benefit SEO.
- **Better User Experience**: Accessibility improvements often lead to a better experience for all users.

### Files Updated

- Button component: `app/components/Button.tsx`
- Form component: `app/components/Form.tsx`
- LazyImage component: `app/components/LazyImage.tsx`
- Layout component: `app/layout.tsx`
- Footer component: `app/components/Footer.tsx`

## Next Steps

### Testing

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more unit tests to increase test coverage.
2. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for complex interactions.
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

### Performance

1. **Further Code Splitting**: Identify more components that can be dynamically imported.
2. **Third-Party Dependencies**: Review and optimize third-party dependencies.
3. **CSS Optimization**: Split CSS to reduce unused styles.

### Accessibility

1. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with screen readers to identify additional issues.
2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Test thoroughly with keyboard navigation.
3. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing with people with disabilities.

## Conclusion
